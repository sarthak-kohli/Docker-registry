Creation of my own docker registry
//on 1st vm {where image is created and pushed )
//Any publically associated image has to have a tag.
docker tag    myst:v1   name/myst:v1      //applying tag to image name

docker push registry:username/imagename:tag   //image naming convention for a personal registry
docker push registry.lw.com:5000/myvimal.com

on 2nd vm //which is our registry server containing all images( here image is pushed &from here image is pulled).

docker run -it --name myreg  registry:latest   //creating a image

docker run -it --name myreg  -p 5000:5000 registry:latest //attaching a port number to it.

docker run -it --name myreg -p 5000:5000 -v /docker_repo:/var/lib/registry registry:latest   //mounting a directory /var/lib of my vm to docker directory/var/lib/registry


docker run -dit --name myreg -p 5000:5000 -v /docker_repo /var/lib/registry registry:latest //final command for server .

//by default when we pull or push it is on https but i did on http so for that certain change in configuration file has to change.
after opening http configuration file at line [12,49],
add --inseccure registry "registry.lw.com":5000

systemctl restart docker//restart service

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart docker

//3rd vm for pulling your image from 2nd and working and using the way you want
docker pull  registry.lw.com:5000/myvimal.com
